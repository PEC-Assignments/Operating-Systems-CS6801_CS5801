    "  The system is assumed to have a fixed number of resources and several processes. Each process has a maximum resource requirement (maximum matrix) and a current allocation (allocation matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Need Calculation:**  \n",
    "  For each process, the remaining resource requirement (need) is computed as:  \n",
    "  **need = maximum – allocation**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety Check:**  \n",
    "  The algorithm checks if the system is in a safe state by trying to find an ordering of processes (a safe sequence) where each process’s remaining need can be satisfied by the available resources. When a process completes, it releases its resources, which are added back to the pool of available resources.\n",

    "  3. **Simulate Process Completion:**  \n",
